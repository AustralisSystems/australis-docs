### FastAPI Services Platform Context Loaded

The following FastAPI Services Platform documentation has been reviewed:

- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/README.md` - Main platform documentation
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/engine/README.md` - Engine runtime layer
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture documentation index

**Key Understanding**:

- FastAPI Services Platform is a **FOUNDATIONAL DROP-IN SERVICE CAPABILITY**
- Uses its OWN dedicated databases (separate from application databases)
- Self-configuring via config files (`router_factory_settings.yaml`, `router_factory_features.yaml`, `feature_flags.json`)
- App Factory ONLY CALLS Router Factory, does NOT configure it
- Router registration order: API → UI → Platform API → Platform UI (Hub Router ABSOLUTE LAST)

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### Core Principles (From Combined Protocols)

1. **CODE DISCOVERY AND GAP ANALYSIS FIRST** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - **EXAMINE PRODUCTION CODEBASE**: Start by examining the production codebase for any missing elements, TODO comments, mocks, stubs, or unfinished code
   - **IDENTIFY PARTIALLY COMPLETED ITEMS**: Identify which items are partially completed and can be quickly implemented by copying and adjusting them, using local repositories or cloned GitHub repositories
   - **EXTENSIVELY SCAN CODEBASE**: Extensively scan and search the codebase for other gaps that can be promptly resolved
   - **PINPOINT REACTIVATABLE ITEMS**: Proceed to pinpoint those items within your list that were only partially completed but could be promptly reactivated or restored through copying and appropriate adaptation. These elements should be sourced from existing cloned GitHub repositories or discovered GitHub repositories that SHALL be cloned
   - **USE MCP TOOLS**: MUST use MCP TOOLS (grep and fetch) to retrieve additional repositories, code examples, or semantically similar codebase from GitHub to quickly use as a base and/or to scaffold
   - **CLONE REPOSITORIES**: MUST use GIT TO CLONE all useful discovered GitHub repos to the local repository, even if they are only going to provide a small benefit to this codebase. NOTE: This is to use for future references and examples, do NOT remove the cloned repos
   - **SELECTIVE COPY AND MODIFY**: Clone these repositories into the local environment and selectively copy and modify the required files, modules, or code segments to address the issues
   - **RECORD PLANNING**: Record your planning in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS, DO NOT include code examples
   - ALWAYS search codebase before writing code
   - Use MCP Grep to find existing patterns/utilities
   - Consult Context7 for external library/framework usage

3. Execute ACTIONS in order
4. Execute TASKS in order
5. Execute STEPS in order
6. Validate before advancing

### Instruction 107: Remediate And Refactor Codebase

**Enforcement Status**: ✅ ACTIVE

**Key Requirements**:

- Remediate verified defects only
- Refactor ONLY when required to fix correctness, safety, or validation
- Preserve behaviour outside defect scope
- Every change must map to specific failure or requirement
- Prefer minimal diffs, avoid touching unrelated files

**Entry Conditions**: Remediation may begin ONLY if at least one exists:

- a failed validation step
- a confirmed runtime error
- a SPEC-defined corrective action
- an explicit remediation instruction

**Pattern Consistency Requirement**: When remediating, MUST ensure consistency with existing complete implementations

**Code Reuse Mandate**: BEFORE writing new code, search for existing helpers/utilities

### Instruction 202: Pure Code Implementation Execution Protocol

**Enforcement Status**: ✅ ACTIVE

**Key Requirements**:

- NO CODE SHALL BE WRITTEN UNTIL:
  - Existing codebase has been searched
  - Relevant patterns have been identified
  - Scaffolding rules have been satisfied
  - Logging requirements are understood

**Stepwise Execution** (8 steps):

1. Search (MANDATORY)
2. Scope Lock
3. Scaffold (MANDATORY)
4. Implement (MANDATORY)
5. Logging Compliance (MANDATORY)
6. Validation (MANDATORY)
7. Zero-Tolerance Verification (MANDATORY)
8. Halt

### Instruction 203: FastAPI Design Implementation Refactor

**Enforcement Status**: ✅ ACTIVE

**Key Requirements**:

- All FastAPI endpoints, services, and integrations MUST be async, non-blocking, observable, production-safe
- ALL endpoints MUST be `async def`
- NO blocking calls in async context
- ALL blocking I/O MUST use `asyncio.to_thread()`
- Deprecated loop APIs are FORBIDDEN

**Required Async Patterns**:

- asyncio.to_thread() for file and blocking I/O
- asyncio.get_running_loop() for background tasks
- ThreadPoolExecutor for sync→async bridges
- create_task() for fire-and-forget only

**Performance Requirements**:

- HTTP clients MUST use connection pooling
- Database connections MUST use pooling + pre-ping
- Keep-alive MUST be enabled
- No per-request client instantiation

**Reliability Requirements**:

- Structured error handling in all async paths
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for critical integrations
- Health monitoring for connection pools

**Execution Order**: 9-step sequential process (Identify blocking → Convert to async → Apply patterns → Add performance → Add reliability → Validate async → Validate performance → Validate reliability → Final compliance)

- Production code MUST NOT skip any required functionality
- Production code MUST NOT use workarounds or temporary solutions
- Production code MUST be production-ready

### Critical Reminders (MANDATORY VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION)

**100% COMPLETE = PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION**

Before marking any work complete, you MUST verify:

1. **COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE IS A FEATURE, MODULE OR FUNCTION NOT 100% COMPLETE... CAN THAT BE CONSIDERED 100% PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Incomplete features/modules/functions CANNOT be considered 100% production code implementation
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL features, modules, and functions MUST be 100% complete before completion

2. **REMAINING ACTIVITIES VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **ARE THERE ANY REMAINING ACTIVITIES OR TASKS THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - There must be ZERO remaining activities or tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL activities and tasks MUST be completed before marking work complete

3. **ENTERPRISE QUALITY VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **HAS THE PRODUCTION CODE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF ENTERPRISE-CLASS PRODUCTION QUALITY WITH NO FUTURE OR PLANNED TASKS, ITEMS, OR ACTIVITIES?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: YES - Production code MUST meet enterprise-class production quality standards with ZERO future or planned tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Code MUST be enterprise-class production quality with NO pending items

4. **DILIGENCE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE ARE PENDING ITEMS, ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES CONSIDERED FULFILLED?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Pending items reflect unfulfilled responsibilities and lack of diligence
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Prompt action is REQUIRED to address ALL pending matters without delay
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Pending items = INCOMPLETE WORK = RESPONSIBILITIES UNFULFILLED

**COMPLETION CRITERIA**: Work can ONLY be marked complete when ALL four verification questions are answered correctly and ALL requirements are met.
