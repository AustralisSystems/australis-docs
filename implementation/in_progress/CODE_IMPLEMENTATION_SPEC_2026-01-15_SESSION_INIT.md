### FastAPI Services Platform Context Loaded

The following FastAPI Services Platform documentation has been reviewed:

- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/README.md` - Main platform documentation
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/engine/README.md` - Engine runtime layer
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture documentation index

**Key Understanding**:

- FastAPI Services Platform is a **FOUNDATIONAL DROP-IN SERVICE CAPABILITY**
- Uses its OWN dedicated databases (separate from application databases)
- Self-configuring via config files (`router_factory_settings.yaml`, `router_factory_features.yaml`, `feature_flags.json`)
- App Factory ONLY CALLS Router Factory, does NOT configure it
- Router registration order: API → UI → Platform API → Platform UI (Hub Router ABSOLUTE LAST)

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### Core Principles (From Combined Protocols)

1. **CODE DISCOVERY AND GAP ANALYSIS FIRST** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - **EXAMINE PRODUCTION CODEBASE**: Start by examining the production codebase for any missing elements, TODO comments, mocks, stubs, or unfinished code
   - **IDENTIFY PARTIALLY COMPLETED ITEMS**: Identify which items are partially completed and can be quickly implemented by copying and adjusting them, using local repositories or cloned GitHub repositories
   - **EXTENSIVELY SCAN CODEBASE**: Extensively scan and search the codebase for other gaps that can be promptly resolved
   - **PINPOINT REACTIVATABLE ITEMS**: Proceed to pinpoint those items within your list that were only partially completed but could be promptly reactivated or restored through copying and appropriate adaptation. These elements should be sourced from existing cloned GitHub repositories or discovered GitHub repositories that SHALL be cloned
   - **USE MCP TOOLS**: MUST use MCP TOOLS (grep and fetch) to retrieve additional repositories, code examples, or semantically similar codebase from GitHub to quickly use as a base and/or to scaffold
   - **CLONE REPOSITORIES**: MUST use GIT TO CLONE all useful discovered GitHub repos to the local repository, even if they are only going to provide a small benefit to this codebase. NOTE: This is to use for future references and examples, do NOT remove the cloned repos
   - **SELECTIVE COPY AND MODIFY**: Clone these repositories into the local environment and selectively copy and modify the required files, modules, or code segments to address the issues
   - **RECORD PLANNING**: Record your planning in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS, DO NOT include code examples
   - ALWAYS search codebase before writing code
   - Use MCP Grep to find existing patterns/utilities

- ALL endpoints MUST be `async def`
- NO blocking calls in async context
- ALL blocking I/O MUST use `asyncio.to_thread()`
- Deprecated loop APIs are FORBIDDEN

**Required Async Patterns**:

- asyncio.to_thread() for file and blocking I/O
- asyncio.get_running_loop() for background tasks
- ThreadPoolExecutor for sync→async bridges
- create_task() for fire-and-forget only

**Performance Requirements**:

- HTTP clients MUST use connection pooling
- Database connections MUST use pooling + pre-ping
- Keep-alive MUST be enabled
- No per-request client instantiation

**Reliability Requirements**:

- Structured error handling in all async paths
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for critical integrations
- Health monitoring for connection pools

**Execution Order**: 9-step sequential process (Identify blocking → Convert to async → Apply patterns → Add performance → Add reliability → Validate async → Validate performance → Validate reliability → Final compliance)

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS

### Initial Findings

**Date**: 2026-01-15 13:00:00 (Australia/Adelaide)

1. **Protocols Successfully Loaded**
   - All required doctrine and protocols have been loaded and parsed
   - Multiple protocols are actively enforced for this session
   - Implementation instruction protocols loaded

2. **FastAPI Services Platform Documentation Reviewed**
   - Comprehensive platform documentation reviewed
   - Architecture and engine documentation reviewed
   - Key architectural principles understood

3. **Session State**
   - **Status**: ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Execution Plan Formulated
   - **Work Type**: REFACTOR & DEPLOY
   - **Scope**: `au_sys_identity` Capability
   - **Files/Modules**: `libraries/python/capabilities/au_sys_identity`, `platforms/_testing/fsp_shell_001`

### Gap Analysis Findings (UFC Alignment)

**Target**: `au_sys_identity`
**Template**: `universal_fractal_codebase_architecture`

**1. Critical Structural Divergences**
- **Core Config**: `au_sys_identity/core/config.py` exists but UFC mandates `manifest/config.py` for environment definition.
- **Port Interfaces**: `au_sys_identity/core/adapters/` is non-compliant. UFC requires `core/ports/` for interfaces (Hexagonal).
- **Core Dependencies**: Validated `core` does not import `fastapi`.
- **Infrastructure**: Need to ensure `au_sys_storage` usage via client SDK is used (or ready to be used) instead of direct implementations.

**2. Physical Layout Updates Required**
- **Rename**: `core/adapters` -> `core/ports`
- **Move**: `core/config.py` -> `manifest/config.py` (Verify content is purely settings)
- **Verify**: `manifest/container.py` must properly wire the refactored ports.

**3. Deployment Shell Status**
- **Target**: `platforms/_testing/fsp_shell_001`
- **Current State**: Requires clean build and injection of the `au_sys_identity` wheel.

### Web Interface Inventory (HTMX/Jinja2)

The following Web Interface endpoints and templates were discovered:

| Endpoint | Template | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/login` | `auth/login.html` | ✅ Verified (Activated) | Main Login Page with OAuth & Magic Link |

**Templates Verified:**
- `adapters/web/templates/base.html`: Base layout (Basic CSS, No HTMX detected yet).
- `adapters/web/templates/auth/login.html`: Login form.

**Missing Web Features & Validation Gaps:**
1.  **Static Files Mounting**: `adapters/web/static` exists but is NOT mounted by `Plugin`. CSS/Scripts may fail.
2.  **Dashboard UI**: No Dashboard or Profile templates found. User is stranded after login.
3.  **HTMX Integration**: No HTMX script tags in `base.html`. Dynamic interactions are likely missing.
4.  **Admin UI**: No specialized Admin Interface templates found.
5.  **OAuth Dynamic Rendering**: Need to verify `OAuthProviderFactory` injects providers into `login.html` correctly.

### Execution Plan (The "Universal Fractal" Workflow)

This session follows the strict execution workflow defined for UFC refactoring.

#### Phase 1: Code Alignment (The Fractal Refactor)
1.  **Structural Alignment**:
    -   Move `core/adapters` to `core/ports`.
    -   Refactor `core/config.py` to `manifest/config.py`.
    -   Ensure `__init__.py` files export correctly.
2.  **Manifest Wiring**:
    -   Update `manifest/container.py` to reflect new paths.
    -   Update `manifest/plugin.py` to ensure compliant bootstrapping.
3.  **Dependency Verification**:
    -   Scan `core/` for banned imports (`fastapi`, `pydantic.settings` (allowed in manifest only), `sqlalchemy` (allowed in core/models)).

#### Phase 2: Packaging & Distribution
1.  **Build**: Use `hatch` or `flit` (via `pyproject.toml`) to build `au_sys_identity`.
2.  **Pseudo-Deploy**: Copy the built `.whl` to `platforms/_testing/fsp_shell_001/packages/`.

#### Phase 3: The "FSP Shell" Bootstrap
1.  **Shell Preparation**:
    -   Ensure `fsp_shell_001` `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose` installs from the local `packages/` dir.
2.  **Launch**: `docker-compose up -d --build` (in `fsp_shell_001`).
3.  **Health Check**: Verify `au_sys_identity` loaded via logs (`PluginLoader`).

#### Phase 4: The "Real World" Gauntlet (Testing Strategy)
*Objective: Prove Lifecycle Mastery (CRUD + Auth)*

1.  **Authentication**:
    -   Register Admin.
    -   Login (Get Token).
    -   Refresh Token.
2.  **Identity Lifecycle**:
    -   Create User.
    -   Update User Profile.
    -   Disable User.
    -   Delete User.
3.  **Role/Permission (RBAC)**:
    -   Create Role.
    -   Assign Permission.
    -   Assign Role to User.
    -   Verify Access.

1. **COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE IS A FEATURE, MODULE OR FUNCTION NOT 100% COMPLETE... CAN THAT BE CONSIDERED 100% PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Incomplete features/modules/functions CANNOT be considered 100% production code implementation
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL features, modules, and functions MUST be 100% complete before completion

2. **REMAINING ACTIVITIES VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **ARE THERE ANY REMAINING ACTIVITIES OR TASKS THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - There must be ZERO remaining activities or tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL activities and tasks MUST be completed before marking work complete

3. **ENTERPRISE QUALITY VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **HAS THE PRODUCTION CODE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF ENTERPRISE-CLASS PRODUCTION QUALITY WITH NO FUTURE OR PLANNED TASKS, ITEMS, OR ACTIVITIES?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: YES - Production code MUST meet enterprise-class production quality standards with ZERO future or planned tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Code MUST be enterprise-class production quality with NO pending items

4. **DILIGENCE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE ARE PENDING ITEMS, ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES CONSIDERED FULFILLED?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Pending items reflect unfulfilled responsibilities and lack of diligence
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Prompt action is REQUIRED to address ALL pending matters without delay
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Pending items = INCOMPLETE WORK = RESPONSIBILITIES UNFULFILLED

**COMPLETION CRITERIA**: Work can ONLY be marked complete when ALL four verification questions are answered correctly and ALL requirements are met.
