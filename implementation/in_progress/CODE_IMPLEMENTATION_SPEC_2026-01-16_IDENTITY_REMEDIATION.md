## 📊 SESSION SUMMARY

### Session Objective

This session is initialized for code implementation and remediation following the combined execution protocols. The primary goal is to remediate the `au_sys_identity` capability to alignment with the **Universal Fractal Codebase (UFC)** and **Tier 1 Governance Compliance**.

The session enforces multiple critical protocols:

- **000-DOCTRINE-Enterprise_Canonical_Execution** (v2.0.1) - ENFORCED
- **001-PROTOCOL-The_GoldenRule_Execution** (v2.0.1) - ENFORCED
- **002-PROTOCOL-Zero_Tolerance_Remediation** (v2.0.0) - ENFORCED
- **003-PROTOCOL-FastAPI_Pure_Code_Implementation** (v2.0.0) - ENFORCED
- **004-PROTOCOL-Validate_Remediate_Codebase** (v2.0.0) - ENFORCED
- **006-PROTOCOL-RFC2119_Requirements_Language** (v1.0.0) - ENFORCED

3.  **High-Assurance Implementation**: Implement Audit Chain of Custody, Trinity Binding, and Graph Encryption.
    - [x] Phase 2: Functional Compliance (Security & Governance) (COMPLETED)
        - [x] Task 2.1: Audit Chain of Custody
        - [x] Task 2.2: Trinity Binding (Tethering)
        - [x] Task 2.3: Graph Encryption
        - [x] Task 2.4: mTLS & CASB Middleware

## 📝 EXECUTION LOG

### 2026-01-16 - Session Initialization
- **Action**: Created Session Specification.
- **Context**: Handover received, Implementation Plan and Task List initialized.
- **Next Step**: Begin Structural Remediation (renaming/refactoring models).

### 2026-01-16 - Structural Remediation Completed
- **Action**: Completed Phase 1 (Structural Alignment).
- **Outcome**:
    - Moved and renamed SQLAlchemy models to `core/models/iam_*.py` and `rbac_*.py`.
    - Exploded `orbac.py` and `iam.py` into strict 1:1 files.
    - Moved Pydantic schemas to `adapters/api/schemas/iam_*.py` and `rbac_*.py`.
    - Fixed imports in routers and provider factory to refect new structure.
    - Verified strict 1:1 mapping is now possible.
- **Next Step**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Chain of Custody).

### Critical Reminders (MANDATORY BEFORE COMPLETION)

**BEFORE MARKING ANY WORK COMPLETE, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **100% COMPLETE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Is every feature, module, and function 100% complete?
   - ❓ Can incomplete features/modules/functions be considered 100% production code implementation?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - Incomplete code CANNOT be considered production code
   - **ACTION**: Complete ALL features, modules, and functions to 100% before completion

2. **ZERO PENDING ITEMS VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Are there any remaining activities or tasks that require attention?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - There must be ZERO remaining activities or tasks
   - **ACTION**: Complete ALL activities and tasks before marking work complete

3. **ENTERPRISE QUALITY VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Has production code been fully implemented to meet enterprise-class production quality standards?
   - ❓ Are there any future or planned tasks, items, or activities?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: YES to quality, NO to pending items
   - **ACTION**: Ensure enterprise-class production quality with ZERO pending items

4. **DILIGENCE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ If there are pending items, are responsibilities considered fulfilled?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - Pending items = unfulfilled responsibilities = lack of diligence
   - **ACTION**: Prompt action REQUIRED to address ALL pending matters without delay

**COMPLETION BLOCKER**: Work CANNOT be marked complete if ANY of these verifications fail.

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Unfulfilled verifications reflect lack of diligence and require immediate attention.
