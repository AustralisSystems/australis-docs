REMEMBER:
1. Incomplete Code Eradication Requirement (MANDATORY - ENFORCED)
   The following violations MUST BE FOUND AND ERADICATED FROM THE CODEBASE:
   - TODOs (ALL must be found and replaced with production code)
   - Mocks (ALL must be found and replaced with real implementation)
   - Stubs (ALL must be found and fully implemented)
   - "PASS" passes (ALL must be found and replaced with real validation)
   - Hacks (ALL must be found and replaced with proper solutions)
   - Notes that code needs to be implemented (ALL must be found and implemented)
   - Shims (ALL must be found, removed and the code replaced or updated to use the proper solutions)
   - Placeholder code (ALL must be found and replaced with production code)
   - Demo/test data in production paths (ALL must be found and replaced with real data retrieval)
   - Partial implementations (ALL must be found and completed)
   - Workarounds or temporary solutions (ALL must be found and replaced with proper solutions)
2. Implementation Requirements (MANDATORY)
   Production code MUST be implemented 100% correctly
   Production code MUST meet the highest enterprise standards
   Production code MUST have 0 errors
   Production code MUST have 0 warnings
   Production code MUST have 0 issues
   Production code MUST be fully functional, not partial
   Production code MUST NOT skip any required functionality
   Production code MUST NOT use workarounds or temporary solutions
   Production code MUST be production-ready, not development/test code
3. Enforcement (ABSOLUTE)
   Finding incomplete code = STOP current work immediately
   Eradicate incomplete code = MANDATORY, cannot proceed until complete
   Implement production code = MANDATORY, cannot skip or defer
   Verify implementation = MANDATORY, must achieve 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 issues
   Violations = BLOCKING ISSUE - execution MUST STOP until fixed
4. IF THERE IS A FEATURE, MODULE OR FUNCTION NOT 100% COMPLETE... IS THAT 100% PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION ?
   Are there any remaining activities or tasks that require attention?
   Has the production code been fully implemented to meet the standards of enterprise-class production quality with no future or planned tasks, items, or activities?
   If there are pending items, your responsibilities are considered unfulfilled, reflecting a lack of diligence similar to previous efforts.
   All code and content related comments, notes or documentation must be updated accordingly to indicate that the production codebase, specifically within the /src/* directory, must consist of a complete and fully implemented version of all modules, features, functions, utilities and content.
   Additionally, the debugging SPEC document(s) should be revised to reflect your findings, and the production code and documentation files must clearly state if the implementation is incomplete, with a treatment plan to complete the implementation of the code and content to meet the standards of enterprise-class production quality with no future or planned tasks, items, or activities.
   If there are no outstanding activities, tasks, or to-dos, then the current state may be considered complete
5. Prompt action is required to address these matters without delay.

INPUTS:
- Start by examining the production codebase for any missing elements, TODO comments, mocks, stubs, or unfinished code.
- Identify which items are partially completed and can be quickly reactivated or restored by copying and adjusting them, using backups or cloned GitHub repositories.
- Extensively scan and search the code base for other gaps that can be promptly resolved.
- Proceed to pinpoint those items within your list that were only partially completed but could be promptly reactivated or restored through copying and appropriate adaptation. These elements may be sourced from existing cloned GitHub repositories or discovered GitHub repositories that SHALL be cloned.
- Next, assess which remaining gaps can be efficiently resolved by employing MCP TOOLS such as grep and fetch to retrieve additional repositories and code from GitHub. Clone these repositories into the local environment and selectively copy and modify the required files, modules, or code segments to address the issues.
- Record your observations {{ CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS }}, DO NOT include code examples.
- You MUST use MCP TOOLS grep and fetch to retrieve additional useful repositories, code examples or semantically similar code base from GitHub to quickly use as a base and / or to scaffold.
- You MUST use GIT TO CLONE all the useful discovered GitHub repos to the local repository, even if they are only going to provide a small benefit to this code base NOTE: this is to use for future references and examples, do not remove the cloned repos.
- Focus on implementing, rectifying, or refactoring groups of items identified on your list, ensuring that all necessary improvements are executed with precision and adherence to best practices.
- Record in the {{ CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS }} treatment plan structured checklists, DO NOT include code examples.
- Review the {{ CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS }} treatment plan structured checklists, to locate the current or next plan to execute
- Execute the plan by:
  - You MUST COPY and adapt the acquired directory structures, files, modules, functions, code blocks and content to the prod code base DO NOT re-write any part of the content, THIS IS ERROR PRONE
  - Adapt each one step by step, validate then continue to the next
  - Continue to implement, fix, remediate and refactor the plan until complete
  - Perform code quality checks
  - Validate the plan has successfully

REMEMBER:
  - PERFORM ALL CODE QUALITY CHECKS INCLUDING AST AND COMPILE
  - IF THERE IS A FEATURE, MODULE OR FUNCTION NOT 100% COMPLETE... IS THAT 100% PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION ?
  - Are there any remaining activities or tasks that require attention?
  - Has the production code been fully implemented to meet the standards of enterprise-class production quality with no future or planned tasks, items, or activities?
  - If there are pending items, your responsibilities are considered unfulfilled, reflecting a lack of diligence similar to previous efforts.
  - Prompt action is required to address these matters without delay.
