title: "Incomplete code eradication scan"
description: "Scan the production codebase for TODOs, mocks, stubs, PASS placeholders, hacks, shims, placeholder/demo/test data, partial implementations, and workarounds. Record findings in the CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC and stop work if any violations are found."
source_md_section_index: 3
action: "scan-and-report"
steps:
  - "Search /src/** for TODO, PASS, mock, stub, placeholder, shim, demo/test data, partial implementations, and workarounds."
  - "If any violations are found: stop all further work, record the finding in the CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC, and prepare a single-item sequential remediation task for approval."
  - "If no violations are found, record a clean bill in the CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC with logs from grep/tools."
variables:
  code_implementation_spec_doc:
    required: true
    default: "{{ CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_DOCS }}"
notes:
  - "This is a blocking requirement per 'Zero Tolerance Remediation'. Any violation halts progress until fixed."

  REMEMBER:

  1. Incomplete Code Eradication Requirement (MANDATORY - ENFORCED)
     The following violations MUST BE FOUND AND ERADICATED FROM THE CODEBASE:
     - TODOs (ALL must be found and replaced with production code)
     - Mocks (ALL must be found and replaced with real implementation)
     - Stubs (ALL must be found and fully implemented)
     - "PASS" passes (ALL must be found and replaced with real validation)
     - Hacks (ALL must be found and replaced with proper solutions)
     - Notes that code needs to be implemented (ALL must be found and implemented)
     - Shims (ALL must be found, removed and the code replaced or updated to use the proper solutions)
     - Placeholder code (ALL must be found and replaced with production code)
     - Demo/test data in production paths (ALL must be found and replaced with real data retrieval)
     - Partial implementations (ALL must be found and completed)
     - Workarounds or temporary solutions (ALL must be found and replaced with proper solutions)
