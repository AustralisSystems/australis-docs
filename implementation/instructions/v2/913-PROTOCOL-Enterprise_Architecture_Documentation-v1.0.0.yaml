    Enterprise Architecture Documentation Protocol. Defines comprehensive enterprise
    architecture documentation methodology for professional architecture design documentation.
    Governs architecture scope analysis, high-level design, component architecture, service
    architecture, data architecture, security architecture, performance architecture, network
    architecture, technical specifications, and quality validation. Ensures consistent enterprise
    architecture documentation creation with proper Diataxis framework adherence and professional
    standards. Documentation creation only - NO implementation code or system changes.

  - Accuracy: Technical specifications match implementation requirements
  - Usability: Clear navigation, appropriate depth, consistent terminology
  - Maintainability: Documentation structure supports ongoing updates

  Reference: `quality_framework`

  DATE STAMP & STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS:
  ALL documentation output files MUST follow the `DOCUMENTATION_NAMING_CONVENTION_v1.0.0.md`.
  ALL content MUST adhere to `RFC2119_REQUIREMENTS_LANGUAGE_STANDARD_v1.0.0.md`.
  ALL metadata MUST follow `DOCUMENT_VERSIONING_LIFECYCLE_STANDARD_v1.0.0.md`.

  CRITICAL: Create markdown files (.md) ONLY - NO Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)

  Reference: `date_stamp_requirements`

  VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  Documentation MUST meet all validation criteria:
  - Architecture analysis completed
  - High-level design comprehensive
  - Component documentation detailed
  - Service architecture complete
  - Data architecture comprehensive
  - Security documentation complete
  - Performance architecture documented
  - Network documentation complete
  - Technical specifications detailed
  - Documentation quality validated
  - Markdown files (.md) ONLY created

  Reference: `validation_criteria`

  MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
  - ALL documentation MUST be comprehensive and complete
  - ALL architecture components MUST be analyzed and documented
  - ALL technical specifications MUST be detailed and accurate
  - ALL documentation MUST follow Diataxis framework principles
  - ALL deliverables MUST be created in markdown document format (.md files ONLY)
  - STRICTLY documentation only - NO implementation code creation
  - NEVER create Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) - markdown files (.md) ONLY

  Reference: `mandatory_requirements`

  FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:
  - Creating implementation code or executing changes
  - Making changes to live systems or environments
  - Partial or incomplete architecture documentation
  - Skipping technical specifications or design documentation
  - Creating documentation without proper analysis and validation
  - Creating Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) - markdown files (.md) ONLY

  Reference: `forbidden_practices`

  Remember: This protocol is for enterprise architecture documentation creation ONLY.
  Follow comprehensive documentation methodology, ensure complete coverage, validate quality,
  and create professional markdown documentation with proper date stamps. Markdown files
  (.md) ONLY - NO Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).
