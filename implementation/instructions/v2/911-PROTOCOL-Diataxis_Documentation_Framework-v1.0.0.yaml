    Diataxis Documentation Framework Protocol. Defines the comprehensive Diataxis
    framework for structured documentation creation following learning, task, information,
    and understanding orientations. Governs documentation type selection, audience targeting,
    content structure, quality validation, and user journey mapping. Ensures consistent
    documentation creation with proper framework adherence and professional standards.

  =========================
  DIATAXIS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK PROTOCOL
  =========================

  This protocol defines the comprehensive Diataxis framework for structured documentation
  creation following learning, task, information, and understanding orientations.

  FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW:
  The Diataxis Documentation Framework provides four distinct documentation types, each
  serving different user needs and orientations:

  1. Tutorial (Learning-oriented) - Enable newcomers to get started
  2. How-To (Task-oriented) - Show how to solve specific problems
  3. Reference (Information-oriented) - Provide technical information for lookup
  4. Explanation (Understanding-oriented) - Illuminate and provide insight

  Reference: `diataxis_framework_overview`

  FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS:
  Before creating documentation, you MUST complete comprehensive framework analysis to
  determine the appropriate documentation type based on:
  - Audience needs and knowledge level
  - Content goals and objectives
  - User orientation (learning, task, information, understanding)
  - Success criteria and outcomes

  Reference: `diataxis_framework_analysis`

  TEN PHASE EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
  1. Framework Analysis and Type Selection
  2. Tutorial Creation (if tutorial type selected)
  3. How-To Creation (if how-to type selected)
  4. Reference Creation (if reference type selected)
  5. Explanation Creation (if explanation type selected)
  6. Content Structure and Organization
  7. User Journey Mapping and Experience Design
  8. Quality Assurance and Framework Validation
  9. Documentation Testing and User Validation
  10. Final Documentation Compilation and Delivery

  Reference: `ten_phase_execution_protocol`

  QUALITY PRINCIPLES:
  All documentation MUST adhere to four core quality principles:
  - Clarity: Clear, unambiguous language appropriate for audience
  - Completeness: Comprehensive coverage with no information gaps
  - Accuracy: Technically correct and up-to-date information
  - Usability: Intuitive navigation and accessible design

  Reference: `quality_principles`

  DATE STAMP REQUIREMENTS:
  ALL documentation output files MUST use reverse date stamp format: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS
  Example: Documentation_Complete_2025-09-22-142155.ipynb

  DATE STAMP & STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS:
  ALL documentation output files MUST follow the `DOCUMENTATION_NAMING_CONVENTION_v1.0.0.md`.
  ALL content MUST adhere to `RFC2119_REQUIREMENTS_LANGUAGE_STANDARD_v1.0.0.md`.
  ALL metadata MUST follow `DOCUMENT_VERSIONING_LIFECYCLE_STANDARD_v1.0.0.md`.

  Reference: `date_stamp_requirements`

  VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  Documentation MUST meet all validation criteria:
  - Framework analysis completed
  - Content created according to selected type
  - Structure follows Diataxis principles
  - Audience targeting appropriate
  - User experience optimized
  - Quality validated
  - User testing completed
  - Professional presentation ensured
  - Objectives achieved
  - Deliverables completed with timestamps

  Reference: `validation_criteria`

  MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
  - ALL documentation MUST follow Diataxis framework principles strictly
  - ALL content MUST be appropriate for selected documentation type
  - ALL documentation MUST target specific audience appropriately
  - ALL content MUST achieve stated learning objectives
  - ALL documentation MUST be created in markdown document format
  - STRICTLY documentation only - NO implementation code creation

  Reference: `mandatory_requirements`

  FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:
  - Creating implementation code or executing changes
  - Making changes to live systems or environments
  - Mixing Diataxis documentation types inappropriately
  - Creating documentation without proper framework analysis
  - Skipping audience targeting or content validation
  - Creating placeholder or incomplete documentation
  - Creating documentation files without proper date stamps

  Reference: `forbidden_practices`

  Remember: This protocol is for documentation creation ONLY. Follow Diataxis framework
  principles strictly, select appropriate documentation type, target audience correctly,
  and ensure professional presentation with proper date stamps.
