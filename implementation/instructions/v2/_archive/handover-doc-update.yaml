HANDOVER DOCUMENT UPDATE

### [CONTEXT]

HANDOVER_DOC_DIR = "./docs/implementation/handovers"

All handover documents must be stored at:

```
{{ HANDOVER_DOC_DIR }}
```

You are updating an existing **handover document** located at:

```
{{ HANDOVER_DOC_DIR }}/{{ HANDOVER_DOC_PATH }}
```

This document functions as the **central coordination and continuity artifact** across multiple parallel workstreams and sessions.

---

### [PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]

Enhance the handover document with a **comprehensive, session-specific reflection and status update** that ensures continuity, clarity, and preparedness for subsequent sessions—**without impacting unrelated workstreams**.

---

### [STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS]

**Step 1 — Session Reflection Enhancement**
Add a new or expanded section that provides a **comprehensive reflection on this specific session**, including:

* Key achievements and outcomes delivered
* Significant challenges encountered
* Lessons learned, insights gained, and implications for future work

This reflection must be **session-scoped** and not generalized across other parallel efforts.

---

**Step 2 — Progress & Status Clarification**
Update the document sections that track progress by:

* Clearly identifying what has been **completed during this session**
* Explicitly listing what tasks remain **outstanding or pending**
* Ensuring a clear distinction between completed work and future work

All updates must accurately reflect the **current state at the end of this session**.

---

**Step 3 — Reference & Continuity Linking**
Identify and include:

* Citations and links to any **relevant documents, files, repositories, or content**
* References that will be **valuable context for the next session**
* Materials required to enable a smooth continuation of work

Links and references must be precise, relevant, and session-appropriate.

---

### [CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE]

* **Do NOT modify, rewrite, or alter any existing content** that is unrelated to this specific session
* **Do NOT impact parallel workstreams** tracked within the same document
* Treat the handover document as a **shared source of truth** across multiple ongoing efforts
* All additions must be **clearly scoped, additive, and traceable to this session only**

Violation of these constraints constitutes **mission failure**.

---

### [PARALLEL WORKSTREAM AWARENESS]

* Multiple parallel streams of work are active simultaneously
* This document serves as the **central tracking and communication layer** connecting those streams
* All updates must preserve **accuracy, integrity, and continuity** across sessions

Disciplined adherence ensures that **each session builds cleanly on the last** without cross-contamination.

---

### [OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]

The updated handover document must result in:

1. A clear, session-specific reflection (achievements, challenges, lessons learned)
2. An unambiguous view of completed vs. outstanding tasks
3. A well-referenced handoff enabling the next session to proceed without context loss
4. Zero unintended changes to unrelated content or workstreams
