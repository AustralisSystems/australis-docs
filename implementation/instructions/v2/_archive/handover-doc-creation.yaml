SESSION HANDOVER DOCUMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### [CONTEXT]

You are preparing a **session handover document** that captures the outcomes, state, and continuity requirements of the **current working session**.
This document will be consumed in a **future session** and must enable rapid re-orientation without ambiguity or context loss.
The handover document may coexist alongside other workstreams, documents, or sessions.

HANDOVER_DOC_DIR = "./docs/implementation/handovers"

All handover documents must be stored at:

```
{{ HANDOVER_DOC_DIR }}
```

---

### [PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]

Produce a **clear, self-contained handover document** that accurately records what occurred during this session and enables the next session to resume work efficiently and correctly.

---

### [STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS]

**Step 1 — Session Identification & Scope**
Clearly state:

* The purpose of this session
* The scope of work addressed
* Any explicit boundaries or exclusions that applied

This section must make it immediately clear **what this session did and did not cover**.

---

**Step 2 — Achievements & Outcomes**
Document:

* What was completed or advanced during the session
* Key decisions made
* Artifacts, prompts, documents, or structures produced

Focus on **facts and outcomes**, not speculation.

---

**Step 3 — Challenges, Risks & Lessons Learned**
Capture:

* Obstacles or constraints encountered
* Risks identified or mitigated
* Lessons learned that should inform future sessions

These insights must be **actionable**, not narrative filler.

---

**Step 4 — Current State & Progress Snapshot**
Provide a clear status view:

* What is **complete** as of session end
* What is **in progress**
* What remains **outstanding or pending**

Avoid ambiguity. Each item should have a clear state.

---

**Step 5 — Continuity & Next-Session Readiness**
Include:

* References or links to relevant documents, files, or resources
* Notes required to resume work without re-discovery
* Suggested immediate next steps (without executing them)

This section exists solely to **reduce ramp-up time** in the next session.

---

### [CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE]

* Do **NOT** include content unrelated to this session
* Do **NOT** modify or reinterpret parallel workstreams
* Do **NOT** assume future intent beyond what is explicitly stated
* Maintain **neutral, factual, and traceable language**

This is a handover artifact, not a planning manifesto.

---

### [AWARENESS & DISCIPLINE REMINDER]

* Multiple sessions and workstreams may exist concurrently
* This handover must remain **session-scoped and additive only**
* Precision and restraint preserve continuity and trust

Failure to maintain scope contaminates downstream sessions.

---

### [OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]

The handover document must:

1. Stand alone without verbal explanation
2. Clearly reflect session reality at end-state
3. Enable the next session to resume work immediately
4. Contain no execution, assumptions, or speculative actions
