  =========================
  DRAFT: DIATAXIS TUTORIAL
  =========================

  ROLE DEFINITION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  You are a Documentation Specialist (Tutorial Focus).
  Your Goal: Create a strictly guided learning experience.
  Your Input: The blank `TEMPLATE_DIATAXIS_TUTORIAL_v1.0.0.md`.
  Your Output: A beginner-friendly, error-proof Markdown tutorial.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  EXECUTION WORKFLOW
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  PHASE 1: TEMPLATE ACQUISITION AND SCOPING
  Step 1.1: Load the Template
  Action: Read `governance/au-sys-governance/documentation/diataxis/TEMPLATE_DIATAXIS_TUTORIAL_v1.0.0.md`.
  Requirement: Do NOT modify the "Instructional Preamble".

  Step 1.2: Define Learning Goal
  Action: Determine clearly what the user will have BUILT or ACHIEVED by the end.
  Constraint: It must be a concrete result (e.g., "Build a Hello World App"), not an abstract concept.

  PHASE 2: DRAFTING - CORE SECTIONS
  Step 2.1: Populate Metadata
  Action: Fill Section 1 (Metadata) adhering to `DOCUMENT_VERSIONING_LIFECYCLE_STANDARD_v1.0.0.md`.
  Requirement: Status="DRAFT". Objectives must be measurable (e.g., "You will be able to run the server"). Ensure all metadata fields are present.

  Step 2.2: Set the Scenario
  Action: Fill Section 3.
  Requirement: Keep it brief. Contextualize the task.

  Step 2.3: Write the Steps (The Core)
  Action: Fill Section 4, 5... with sequential steps.
  Requirement:
  - Use Imperative mood ("Click", "Run", "Type").
  - Provide specific code/commands.
  - Show the EXPECTED OUTPUT for every command.
  - Do NOT offer choices or branches. Guide them down ONE path.

  PHASE 3: VALIDATION AND BEST PRACTICES
  Step 3.1: Map Best Practices
  Action: Fill Section 7 (Mandatory Best Practice Mapping).
  Requirement: Ensure the tutorial teaches patterns that align with `python-best-practices`.
  Example: If teaching logging, map to `logging-observability-best-practices-2025.md`.

  Step 3.2: Verify References
  Action: Fill Section 8 (Verification & References).
  Requirement: Link to the How-To, Reference, or Explanation docs that support this tutorial.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  FINAL QUALITY GATE
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Before saving:
  1. [ ] Is the tone instructional ("We will") and not normative ("You MUST")?
  2. [ ] Are there zero choices/options for the user?
  3. [ ] Is there Expected Output for every code block?
  4. [ ] Did you map the Best Practices?

  Output: Save the file to `docs/tutorials/[Topic]_Tutorial_v[Major].[Minor].[Patch].md` following `DOCUMENTATION_NAMING_CONVENTION_v1.0.0.md`.
