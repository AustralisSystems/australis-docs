    Code Documentation Protocol. Defines comprehensive code documentation methodology
    for production code documentation and API reference creation. Governs system component
    discovery, API documentation, developer guides, operations documentation, security
    documentation, module dependencies, performance documentation, and quality validation.
    Ensures consistent code documentation creation with proper completeness validation and
    professional standards. Documentation creation only - NO implementation code or system changes.

  CODE DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL
  =========================

  This protocol defines comprehensive code documentation methodology for production code
  documentation and API reference creation.

  FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW:
  The Code Documentation Framework provides comprehensive documentation coverage across
  10 phases:

  1. System Component Discovery and Analysis
  2. API Documentation and Reference Creation
  3. Developer Documentation and Implementation Guides
  4. Operations Documentation and Runbooks
  5. Security Documentation and Compliance
  6. Module Dependencies and Integration Documentation
  7. Performance and Optimization Documentation
  8. Documentation Generation and Automation
  9. Documentation Quality Assurance and Validation
  10. Documentation Compilation and Deliverable Creation

  Reference: `ten_phase_execution_protocol`

  DOCUMENTATION SCOPE TYPES:
  - Comprehensive: Complete documentation of entire codebase
  - API-Focused: API documentation and function references
  - Developer Guide: Developer documentation and implementation guides
  - Operations: Operations documentation and runbooks
  - Security: Security documentation and compliance guides
  - Module-Specific: Module-specific documentation

  Reference: `code_documentation_overview`

  CODEBASE TARGET TYPES:
  - Entire Codebase: Complete codebase documentation
  - Specific Modules: Specific module documentation
  - Services: Service-level documentation
  - Components: Component-level documentation
  - API Layer: API layer documentation
  - Data Layer: Data layer documentation

  Reference: `code_documentation_overview`

  TEN PHASE EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
  1. System Component Discovery: Discover and catalog all components
  2. API Documentation: Document all public APIs and functions
  3. Developer Documentation: Create developer guides and implementation details
  4. Operations Documentation: Document deployment and maintenance procedures
  5. Security Documentation: Document security architecture and compliance

  Reference: `ten_phase_execution_protocol`

  QUALITY FRAMEWORK:
  Documentation standards include:
  - Completeness Score: Function (100%), Parameter (100%), Example (80%), Test (90%)
  - Documentation Quality: Comprehensive, Accurate, Current, Accessible, Searchable

  - API documentation comprehensive
  - Developer guides complete
  - Operations documentation complete
  - Security documentation complete
  - Module dependencies mapped
  - Performance documentation complete

  Reference: `mandatory_requirements`

  FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:
  - Creating implementation code or executing changes
  - Making changes to live systems or environments
  - Partial or incomplete code documentation
  - Skipping API documentation or function references
