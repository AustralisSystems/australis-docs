    directives:
      - id: "documentation_only"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Enterprise architecture documentation work MUST be documentation-only and MUST NOT include implementation changes or system/environment changes."
        rationale: "Keeps architecture work reviewable and avoids accidental production impact."
        verification: "Only documentation artefacts are created/modified as part of the task."

      - id: "scope_and_audience_first"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Architecture documents MUST state scope, system boundaries, and target audience (executive/technical/developer/operations) before detailed design."
        rationale: "Architecture without scope is untestable and often unusable."
        verification: "Doc includes an explicit scope/boundaries/audience section."

      - id: "include_required_views"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Architecture documentation MUST cover the relevant views for the scope (at minimum: high-level context + component/service relationships; optionally data/security/performance/network as required)."
        rationale: "Architecture is multi-view; missing views create downstream ambiguity."
        verification: "Doc includes the declared views with consistent terminology and cross-references."

      - id: "include_diagrams"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Architecture documents MUST include at least one diagram (eg Mermaid) that reflects the described system boundaries and component interactions."
        rationale: "Diagrams improve comprehension and expose gaps/contradictions."
        verification: "Diagram is present and consistent with the text."

      - id: "rfc2119_for_normative_docs"
        level: "required"
        statement: "If a document is normative, it MUST use RFC 2119 keywords correctly and include any required RFC 2119 preamble/metadata indicators."
        rationale: "Normative language must be explicit and unambiguous."
        verification: "RFC 2119 keywords are uppercase and used consistently for normative statements."

      - id: "markdown_only"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Architecture deliverables MUST be markdown (.md) unless an explicit exception is approved."
        rationale: "Markdown is diff-friendly and is the repo's canonical documentation format."
        verification: "Deliverables are .md and render correctly."

      - id: "use_templates_when_available"
        level: "recommended"
        statement: "When governance architecture templates exist, authors SHOULD start from the template and preserve any instructional preamble sections."
        rationale: "Templates enforce consistent structure and required metadata."
        verification: "Doc structure matches the template and required template sections remain intact."
