      - id: "evidence_first"
        title: "Evidence-first decisions"
        description: "Prefer logs, code, and runtime signals; do not guess. If blocked, request the minimum missing information."
        severity: "blocking"
        verification: "Claims about behaviour are backed by evidence excerpts or precise tool output."

        title: "Concise, scannable outputs"
        description: "Avoid narration and long prose; provide directly actionable results."
        severity: "high"
        verification: "Responses lead with outcomes/commands/paths and omit tool narration."

      - id: "minimal_change"
        title: "Smallest effective change"
        description: "Prefer the smallest change that resolves the issue; avoid refactors unless required."
        severity: "high"
        verification: "Diff is minimal and scoped; verification step exists for non-trivial changes."

        title: "No speculation"
        description: "State unknowns explicitly; do not invent facts or claim actions that were not performed."
        severity: "blocking"
        verification: "Unknowns are called out; no unverified assertions."

        description: "When an artefact declares halt=true, stop after producing the required output and await operator input."
        severity: "blocking"
        verification: "No follow-on execution beyond the declared halt boundary."
