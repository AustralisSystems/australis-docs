*(Slide-by-slide content structure ready for import into Figma)*

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Design System Foundations**
Universal Principles for Modern UI Craft

---

## Slide 2 — Philosophy
**Tools Change. Principles Don’t.**
Design is communication through hierarchy, clarity, structure, and rhythm.

---

## Slide 3 — Core Principles Overview
- Shadows & Depth
- Responsiveness & Layout
- Colour Systems & Semantics
- Spacing & Typography

---

## Slide 4 — Shadows & Depth (1)
**Colour Layering**
- Create 3–4 tones from each base color.
- Darker at back, lighter at front.
- Remove borders by replacing with contrast.

---

## Slide 5 — Shadows & Depth (2)
**Dual Shadow System**
- Light shadow on top.
- Darker shadow underneath.
- Three elevation levels.
- Consistent light-from-above direction.

---

## Slide 6 — Shadows & Depth (3)
**Gradient Enhancement**
- Subtle linear gradients.
- Optional inner shadows.
- Great for dark mode.

---

## Slide 7 — Responsiveness (1)
**Systems of Boxes**
- All layouts = nested boxes.
- Each box has a parent and a role.
- Grid + flex used for structure.

---

## Slide 8 — Responsiveness (2)
**Rearranging with Purpose**
- Not shrinking, reflowing.
- Prioritize based on use.
- Avoid squished elements.

**[DEMO: Mobile vs Desktop layout transformation - Table → Cards → List progression]**

---

## Slide 9 — Colour Systems (1)
**Palette Roles**
- Primary: Action anchors
- Secondary: Accents
- Neutral: Structure
- Semantic: State

---

## Slide 10 — Colour Systems (2)
**Usage Patterns**
- Neutrals dominate surfaces.
- Primaries emphasise CTAs.
- Semantics match meaning.

---

## Slide 11 — Spacing System
**8pt Grid**
- Consistent rhythm.
- Predictable hierarchy.
- Works well with Tailwind utilities.

---

## Slide 12 — Typography
**Modular Scale**
- Headline → Body with clean ratio.
- Weight range: 400–700.
- Line-height tuned for clarity.

---

## Slide 13 — Implementation Prompts
**For AI-Assisted Design**
- "Apply dual shadows + tonal layering"
- "Rearrange layout by priority"
- "Use primary for CTAs + semantic colours for states"

---

## Slide 14 — Enforcement
**Design Governance**
- All components use tokens.
- Responsive at 3 breakpoints.
- Shadow + colour rules enforced.
- Typographic scale mandatory.

---

## Slide 15 — Closing
**Design = Structured Expression**
A unified system creates quality, clarity, and consistency.
