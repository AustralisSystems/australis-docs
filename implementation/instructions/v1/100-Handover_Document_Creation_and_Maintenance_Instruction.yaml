# CRITICAL REMINDERS

# HANDOVER DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL:
# - They maintain context across sessions
# - They prevent duplicate work
# - They document decisions and knowledge
# - They provide continuity for future developers
# - They reference critical documents and files

# MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
# - MUST be created/updated at end of each session
# - MUST include all mandatory sections
# - MUST maintain date consistency
# - MUST validate all references
# - MUST document all achievements, challenges, and lessons

# DATE CONSISTENCY IS CRITICAL:
# - Filename date MUST match header Date field
# - Section headers MUST use correct session date
# - Last Updated MUST reflect actual update date
# - Previous Session Summary MUST use correct historical dates
# - Date mismatch = CRITICAL ERROR

# QUALITY STANDARDS:
# - Completeness: All sections present and complete
# - Accuracy: All references valid and verified
# - Clarity: Easy to scan and understand
# - Usefulness: Provides value for next session

# ENFORCEMENT:
# - Incomplete handover = BLOCKING ISSUE
# - Missing sections = BLOCKING ISSUE
# - Invalid references = BLOCKING ISSUE
# - Date inconsistencies = CRITICAL ERROR
# - Session MUST NOT end without complete handover
