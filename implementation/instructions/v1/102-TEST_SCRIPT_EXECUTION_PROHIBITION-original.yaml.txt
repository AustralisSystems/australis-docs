# CRITICAL PROHIBITION: Test Script Execution Scripts

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

**YOU ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FROM CREATING ANY SCRIPTS THAT EXECUTE OTHER SCRIPTS**

This prohibition applies to:
- Scripts that run test scripts
- Scripts that execute other Python scripts
- Workflow runners that call test scripts
- Orchestration scripts that execute tests
- Any script that uses `subprocess.run()` to execute test files
- Any script that imports and calls `main()` from test files
- Any script that uses `exec()` or `eval()` to run test code
- Any script that uses `importlib` to dynamically import and execute test modules

## WHAT IS FORBIDDEN

### FORBIDDEN: Scripts That Execute Test Scripts

**NEVER CREATE**:
- `workflow_runner.py` scripts
- `run_tests.py` scripts
- `execute_tests.py` scripts
- `test_orchestrator.py` scripts
- Any script that calls `subprocess.run([sys.executable, "test_*.py"])`
- Any script that imports test modules and calls their functions
- Any script that wraps test execution

### FORBIDDEN: Scripts That Execute Other Scripts

**NEVER CREATE**:
- Scripts that execute other Python scripts
- Scripts that call `main()` from other modules
- Scripts that use `subprocess` to run other scripts
- Scripts that orchestrate script execution

## WHAT IS PERMITTED

### PERMITTED: Direct Test Execution

**ONLY USE**:
- Direct execution: `python tests/.../test_file.py`
- Pytest execution: `pytest tests/.../test_file.py`
- Test files themselves (they can call helper functions, but NOT execute other test scripts)

### PERMITTED: Helper Scripts

**ALLOWED**:
- Helper scripts that provide utilities (not execution)
- Helper scripts that are imported by tests (not executed by scripts)
- Helper scripts that are called directly by users (not by other scripts)

## ENFORCEMENT

### Pre-Creation Checklist

**BEFORE CREATING ANY SCRIPT, ASK**:
1. Does this script execute other scripts? → **IF YES: FORBIDDEN**
2. Does this script call `subprocess.run()` on test files? → **IF YES: FORBIDDEN**
3. Does this script import and call `main()` from test files? → **IF YES: FORBIDDEN**
4. Does this script orchestrate test execution? → **IF YES: FORBIDDEN**

### Violation Detection

**IF YOU FIND YOURSELF CREATING**:
- A script with "runner", "orchestrator", "executor", "workflow" in the name → **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
- A script that uses `subprocess.run()` → **VERIFY IT'S NOT EXECUTING TEST SCRIPTS**
- A script that imports test modules → **VERIFY IT'S NOT CALLING THEIR FUNCTIONS**

### Violation Response

**IF YOU VIOLATE THIS RULE**:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
2. **DELETE THE VIOLATING SCRIPT**
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE THE VIOLATION**
4. **USE DIRECT TEST EXECUTION INSTEAD**

## EXAMPLES

### FORBIDDEN Example

```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Script that executes test scripts
def run_tests():
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "test_file.py"])
```

### PERMITTED Example

```python
# ✅ PERMITTED - Direct test execution by user
# User runs: python test_file.py
# Or: pytest test_file.py
```

## REMEMBER

**THE USER'S WORDS**:
> "u will mandate that stupid fucking bespoke scripts that are prone to failures and issues MUST FUCKING STOP... NO MORE... just use the /tests/* dir script... and do not create any other scripts... especially ones that run the fucknig scripts in the /tests/ dir... or directly bypass the tests/ dir script... that is fucking madness that MUST FUCKING STOP RIGHT NOW"

**THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION - THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**

## SESSION REMINDER

**EVERY SESSION, BEFORE CREATING ANY SCRIPT**:
1. Read this prohibition
2. Verify the script doesn't violate it
3. If unsure, DON'T CREATE IT
4. Use direct test execution instead

**THIS PROHIBITION IS PERMANENT AND ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS**
