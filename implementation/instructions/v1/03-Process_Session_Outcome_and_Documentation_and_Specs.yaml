  critical_rule: >
    **CRITICAL DIRECTORY RULE**: The directories backlog/, in_progress/, and done/ MUST ONLY
    contain SPEC documents (files matching pattern *_SPEC_v*.md). ALL other documents
    (temporal documents, status reports, completion reports, session summaries, etc.) MUST
    be moved to temporal/ AFTER important information has been extracted and used to update
    the implementation plan and other documentation. This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
  critical_documentation_rule: >
    **CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION RULE**: TEMPORAL DOCUMENTS MUST NOT BE CREATED. ALL updates,
    status reports, progress reports, completion reports, session summaries, and findings
    MUST be documented directly in:
    1. The SPEC document(s) themselves (in_progress/ or done/)
    2. The IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v#.#.#.md file

    DO NOT create standalone temporal documents. Instead, update the relevant SPEC(s) and
    IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN with all progress, findings, and status information. This rule is
    NON-NEGOTIABLE and must be enforced strictly.
